Run the benchmark.tscn scene to run benchmarks. It will run all benchmark scenes within its Scenes list.
Add/remove scenes from that list however you like.

New benchmark scenes can easily be created, refer to the galaxy map benchmark scene and its .cs
for how to create your own.

Inherit Benchmarkscene.cs when creating a new benchmarking scene.
-"Use Benchmark Duration": Set to true if you want to run the scene for a set time. IF you do not use this,
 make sure to call ExitScene() when the scene is done.
-"Benchmark Duration": The time the scene runs if it uses benchmark duration
-"Downtime": The time it spends before starting the next benchmark scene of the list (if there are any others).
