## Gravity
 *CelestialBody* acts as wrapper around a mesh (for example) which enables gravity within a *GravityField*
 *CelestialBody* has two bools "AffectedByGravity" and "AffectingGravity" 
 
 Should maybe add a way to group what should be affected by what gravity (similar to collisionmask ?)
 This can maybe be done with nested GravityFields (1 gravityField for the sun, 1 gravityField per planet with moons)
