abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

abstract = {Abstract Procedural noise functions are widely used in computer graphics, from off-line rendering in movie production to interactive video games. The ability to add complex and intricate details at low memory and authoring cost is one of its main attractions. This survey is motivated by the inherent importance of noise in graphics, the widespread use of noise in industry and the fact that many recent research developments justify the need for an up-to-date survey. Our goal is to provide both a valuable entry point into the field of procedural noise functions, as well as a comprehensive view of the field to the informed reader. In this report, we cover procedural noise functions in all their aspects. We outline recent advances in research on this topic, discussing and comparing recent and well-established methods. We first formally define procedural noise functions based on stochastic processes and then classify and review existing procedural noise functions. We discuss how procedural noise functions are used for modelling and how they are applied to surfaces. We then introduce analysis tools and apply them to evaluate and compare the major approaches to noise generation. We finally identify several directions for future work.},

Powerful primitives are included for creating controlled stochastic effects. We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of CGI.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal.

However, adoption is hindered by limitations such as slow generation, as well as low quality and diversity of content. We introduce an evolutionary search-based approach for evolving level generators using novelty search to procedurally generate diverse levels in real time, without requiring training data or detailed domain-specific knowledge. We test our method on two domains, and our results show an order of magnitude speedup in generation time compared to existing methods while obtaining comparable metric scores. We further demonstrate the ability to generalise to arbitrary-sized levels without retraining.},

ABSTRACT = {Procedural content generation (PCG) algorithms have become increasingly vital in video games developed by small studios due to their ability to save time while creating diverse and engaging environments, significantly enhancing replayability by ensuring that each gameplay experience is distinct. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of PCG in generating various game elements, such as levels and weaponry, with unique attributes across different playthroughs. However, these studies often face limitations in processing efficiency and adaptability to real-time applications. The current study introduces an improved spawn algorithm designed for 2D map generation, capable of creating maps with multiple room sizes and a decorative object. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on agent-based evaluations, this constructive algorithm emphasizes reduced processing power, making it suitable for generating small worlds in real time, particularly during loading screens. Our findings highlight the algorithm’s potential to streamline game development processes, especially in resource-constrained environments, while maintaining high-quality content generation.},
